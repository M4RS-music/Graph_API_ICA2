Scenario
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
The assignment provides a set of vertices (cities or road crossings in the
 E.U.) and a set of edges (major E.U.
 roads) as commands meant to be passed to an application program interface
 designed by the student.
 The student was given two cities and asked to code an algorithm in Clojure
 that was capable of finding the shortest path (or proving one does not
 exist) between each city and Prague.
 The student was given

\begin_layout Paragraph*
The aim of this assignment is to describe the most efficient implementation
 of the algorithms specified by the assignment brief.
 This technical report also addresses the graph and helper structures that
 have been implemented as they are a large part of the code being submitted
 and contribute directly to the efficiency of the algorithms.
 All code in this document was written by the author in Clojure a list processin
g programming language.

\begin_layout Paragraph*
The data structure used for the open-queue in this implementation is a red-black
 tree.
 A red-black tree is a self balancing form of a binary search tree.
 The red-black tree is is defined by the following code, a reference to
 the root node of the tree.

\begin_layout Paragraph*
These functions follow the standard procedure for inserting a node into
 a binary search tree.
 If the node being inserted is not the root of the red-black tree the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

node-insert-helper!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 function is called and it runs the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

red-black-rules-checker!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 function after the insertion.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

red-black-rules-checker!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 function checks if the tree is still a red-black tree and performs all
 necessary rotations and color changes necessary to balance and restore
 its state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Justification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Using a red-black tree has a number of benefits.
 Using a list for the open-queue in breadth first search his not optimal.
 In Clojure lists are single-linked which means that the head of the list
 contains a reference to only the first node and nodes only contain a reference
 to the next node and not the previous.
 This means that appending to the list would have a tightly bound linear
 time complexity O(n)= Ω(n)=Θ(n).
 Furthermore accessing the node with the lowest value would have a time
 complexity of O(n) and for the best case scenario Ω(1), as the list is
 not sorted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
The red-black tree solves this problem as it is a form of a binary search
 tree.
 The tree is sorted and thus accessing the node with the lowest value is
 as simple as going to the left-most node of the tree.
 The time complexity of this is tightly bound O(log n)= Ω(log n)=Θ(log n)
 and the memory complexity is constant.
 For insertions the time complexity is not tightly bound O(log n) and Ω(1)
 if the tree is empty.
 This logarithmic time complexity is due to the maximum height of any red-black
 tree which is O(log n) thanks to the self balancing nature of the tree.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
It was considered that the entire graph structure could be represented using
 red-black trees.
 However, the efficiency of this could not be justified as Clojure has a
 hash map structure that has a near constant time complexity for accessing
 and inserting nodes.

\begin_layout Section
Indexing Connected Components
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
In each vertex record structure is as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

component
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 value.
 This value is used to tell whether any two vertices are part of the same
 component.
 This prevents algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm from having to iterate
 through an entire connected component if there exists no path between the
 start and finish vertex.
 The result of this is used to prove there exists no path between two vertices
 (in this code

The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

breadth-first-search-connected-components!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 function accepts 3 arguments graph, start and index.
 The function iterates through the entire connected component of the start
 vertex.
 First the algorithm adds the start vertex to the open-queue.
 While the queue is not empty it sets the left-most node of the red-black
 tree open-queue as the current vertex.
 Then the function sets the component value of the vertex equal to the index
 value passed to the function.
 Finally it adds all the unseen neighbors of the current vertex to the open-queu
e, sets the status of the current vertex to visited and recurs to the stage
 of checking whether the open-queue is empty.
 This function is called by the main indexing function below.

\begin_layout Paragraph*
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

index-components!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 function is a simple tail recursive loop that keeps track of the index
 value that is going to be passed to the breadth first search.
 First the status and distance values of the graph are reset.
 Then the loop calls the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

breadth-first-search-connected-components!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 using the first 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unseen
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 vertex it finds as the start vertex.
 The loop recurs with the increment of the index and runs again.
 The loop fails when it can no longer find an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unseen
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 vertex in the graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
The time complexity of this function is tightly bound and linear O(n)= Ω(n)=Θ(n)
 as the breadth first search will iterate through the entire graph before
 the loop ends.
 The memory complexity of this function is tightly bound and constant O(1)=
 Ω(1)=Θ(1) as it only keeps track of a set amount of nodes at a time.
 This is theoretically the only way to label the connected components of
 a graph as regardless of the traversing function the entire set of vertices
 must be iterated through.
 Thanks to this being run after all the data has been added to the graph,
 the time complexity of proving there exists no path between two vertices
 is near constant due to Clojure's hash maps.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
The algorithm above accepts three arguments one pointing to a graph within
 which are two nodes (start, finish) that are the remaining arguments.
 The algorithm finds the shortest path between these two nodes by running
 a breadth first search from the finish node searching for the start node.
 Breadth first search keeps track of an, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

open queue
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which is a set of vertices that are going to be processed, a set of visited
 or already processed vertices and a current vertex.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
The breadth first search is given the finish node which it adds to the open
 queue along with a value of zero.
 While the open queue is still populated the algorithm removes next vertex
 from open queue and sets it as current vertex.
 The current vertex's distance value (in the graph's record structure) is
 set to the value attributed to it in the open queue.
 In this case the distance is the amount of hops (edges) the node is away
 from the finish.
 Finally all adjacent vertices of the current vertex that have an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unseen
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 status (in the graph's record structure) are added to the open queue with
 the increment of the value of the current vertex.
 The current vertex's status is then set visited.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
The algorithm then choses its next vertex from the open queue and repeats
 the aforementioned steps until it reaches the start node.
 The breadth first search will iterate through the entire connected component
 if it does not reach the start node.
 It is at this point that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dijkstra!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 function would normally evaluate whether or not a path exists between the
 two nodes.
 However, in this implementation each vertex has already been marked with
 an index number corresponding to its connected component.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dijkstra!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 function first checks if the two nodes have equal values in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

component
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 section of their records.
 If the indices do not match there exists no path between the two nodes
 and the breadth first search will not be run.
 If this feature was not implemented the breadth first search algorithm
 would have the iterate through the entire connected component before it
 could assume that there exists no path between the two given nodes.

\begin_layout Paragraph*
The above algorithm is used after the marking phase of Dijkstra's algorithm
 without edge weights.
 The tracing back begins by setting the start vertex to be the current vertex.
 Next the algorithm prints the label of the current vertex.
 If the label of the current vertex is not equal to the finish argument
 the algorithm chooses the neighbor of the current vertex with the lowest
 distance value in its record and sets it to the new current vertex.
 After this the algorithm recurs back to the step where it prints the label
 and repeats stated steps until it reaches the finish.
 At this point Dijkstra's algorithm has finished and the shortest path between
 the start and finish vertices has been printed.

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Choosing the neighbor with the lowest distance to finish (without edge weights)
 is as simple as iterating through all the neighbors and keeping track of
 the lowest distance value over iterations.
 The above function accomplishes exactly that and returns the label of the
 neighbor with the lowest distance to finish.
 The time complexity of this function is tightly bound and linear O(n)=
 Ω(n)=Θ(n) where 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

n
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the number of neighbors of the vertex.
 This is because the distance each neighbor must be checked once to find
 the neighbor with the lowest value.
 The memory complexity of this function is not tightly bound O(n) Ω(1) as
 all of the neighbors must be stored in the loop at the beginning and one
 less is kept track off on each iteration.

\begin_layout Paragraph*
The above function serves only to call all the helper functions associated
 with finding the shortest path between two vertices following Dijkstra's
 algorithm.
 First the function runs the graph reset.
 This is a simple recursive function that iterates through all the vertices
 of the graph and sets their status to unseen and distance to finish to
 infinity.
 The time complexity of this operation is tightly bound and linear O(n)=
 Ω(n)=Θ(n) as it must iterate through each and every node of the red-black
 tree of vertices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Next the function checks if the start and finish vertices are part of the
 same connected component.
 If they are, the function continues otherwise the function terminates without
 entering the marking phase as there exists no path between two nodes that
 are not part of the same connected component.
 The time complexity of this operation is nearly constant because all that
 is happening is the lookup of two nodes within the graph's hash map structure
 which contains the set of vertices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
If the condition is satisfied the function will call the marking stage which
 is a modified breadth first search.
 Once the marking stage completes the function runs the trace back algorithm
 and terminates.

Efficiency and Justification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Aside from possible micro-optimizations this is the most efficient way to
 find the shortest path between two point on a graph.
 This algorithm has been chosen simply because there is no other algorithm
 to find the shortest path between two points in an unweighted graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Several optimizations have already been added to this implementation.
 The worst case scenario for naive Dijkstra's algorithm occurs when there
 exists no path between the vertices supplied.
 With this implementation if the API gets more than

 (where

 is the amount of connected components) requests for nonexistent paths it
 will be more efficient.
 This is because the connected components are counted and marked after the
 entire graph has been recorded.
 The open-queue has also been optimized using a red black tree.

 When deciding if a neighbor has a lower distance than the current distance
 the function checks if difference between the distance values of the neighbor

 If the previous condition is true and the distance is lower than the best

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
In general the subject graph-related algorithms is an extremely nuanced
 part of mathematics in computing.
 There are countless real world applications, even for the algorithms discussed
 in this doccument (networking, GPS Navigation, logistics).
 The authors goal when writing this code was to write the most efficient
 versions of these algorithms withing his capabilities.
 However, this is in no way a claim that there aren't any improvements to
 be made.
 With higher level functions such as this there are so many variables to
 change and optimize (data structure, helper functions) and due to this
 there is always some angle that has not been considered.
 It is the driving force behind competition and improvement in software
 over the years.
 What this assignment did accomplish was the delivery of a clear competent
 explanation of the given algorithms and a justification for the improvements
 that have been made.
